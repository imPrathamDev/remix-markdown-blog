Yoga, a practice that has captivated millions worldwide, boasts a history as flexible and enduring as the discipline itself. From its mysterious origins in ancient India to its current status as a global phenomenon, yoga has undergone significant transformations while maintaining its core essence. In this article, we'll journey through time to explore the fascinating history of yoga, its key developments, and how it has evolved into the practice we know today.

## Ancient Beginnings: The Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1900 BCE)

The roots of yoga are believed to reach back to the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's earliest urban cultures. Archaeological excavations have unearthed seals and figurines in meditative postures, suggesting early forms of yoga practice.

## The Vedic Period (1500-500 BCE)

During this era, the foundational texts of Hinduism, known as the Vedas, were composed. While the term "yoga" appears in the Rigveda, its meaning was different from our modern understanding.

**Significant developments:**

- "Yoga" initially referred to the yoke used to harness animals
- Evolved to mean a "yoking" or union with the divine
- Emphasis on ritual, sacrifice, and living in harmony with cosmic order (rta)

## The Upanishadic Era (800-200 BCE)

- Emphasis on self-realization and meditation
- Development of the idea that union with the divine is achievable through inner contemplation

## The Classical Period (500 BCE - 500 CE)

This period saw the systematization of yoga practices and philosophy, culminating in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras around 400 CE.

- Patanjali's Yoga Sutras codify the Eight Limbs of Yoga, providing a structured approach to yoga practice
- Rise of Buddhism and Jainism, which incorporated and influenced yogic practices
